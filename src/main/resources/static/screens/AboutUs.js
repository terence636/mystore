      <p class="mb-8">MAKITO was formed in 2001 by 3 entreprenuers. They ran a small business from their
          home, selling T-shirts. The business grew faster than they could have ever imagined.
          As the idea of a silk sleeping bag caught on, they began manufacturing “travel” clothing from the silk as
          well. And so the first apparel line was launched, soon followed by silk bedding. The company continued to
          grow.
          Then, at a fabric trade show in 2005, they met a young man who had a vision of his own. A new technology was
          emerging to convert wild-growing bamboo into incredibly soft, sumptuous fabric with a fraction of organic
          cotton’s environmental footprint.
          With the addition of bamboo clothing and bedding, the company experienced yet another surge in growth. 
          Now in its 20th year, ownership has transitioned to a pair of longtime employees with a vision to lead 
          MAKITO into its fullest expression as a sustainable clothing, bedding, and nightwear brand with broad
          multigenerational appeal. MAKITO is committed to fair trade practices from source to shelf, and still 
          thrilled each day by the adventure that lies ahead!</p>
